# COVID-19 Geospatial-Analysis
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the COVID-19 outbreak, focusing on how cases evolved over time in various countries worldwide. Using time series analysis and geospatial visualizations, the project examines trends, identifies infection waves, and provides visual insights into the pandemic's progression across different regions.

Project Highlights

-Data Cleaning and Aggregation: Preprocessed data to handle multiple entries per country, ensuring an accurate cumulative count of COVID-19 cases.

-Trend Analysis: Plotted infection trends over time for selected countries, enabling a clear visualization of how cases rose and fell throughout different stages of the pandemic.

-Wave Identification: Used peak detection to highlight distinct waves of COVID-19 infections in each country.

-Geospatial Visualization: Created a choropleth map to show total COVID-19 cases per country, offering a geographical perspective on the pandemic's global impact.

Python Libraries: pandas, numpy, plotly, geopandas, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn
